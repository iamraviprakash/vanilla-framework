## Vanilla Framework
Vanilla framework is a minimalistic JavaScript framework focused on using pure JavaScript to web applications with no dependencies. I created this project for my practice and to gain understanding of framework internals with taking inspiration from https://frontendmasters.com/courses/vanilla-js-apps

## Features
* **Lightweight**: No additional libraries; pure JavaScript.
* **Customizable**: Gives developers control over every part of the application.
* **Routing**: It has in-house client side routing
* **State management**: Provides global state management to access data in any part for the system.
